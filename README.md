# job_placement

# Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a job placement dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset provides insights into various factors influencing job placements, such as education, experience, skill set, etc. Additionally, several regression models have been applied to predict job placements based on the available features.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and consists of 700 records with 11 features. It includes information such as education level, years of experience, technical skills, and job placement status.

# Analysis
The analysis begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset's structure, distributions, and correlations between variables. Visualizations are utilized to highlight key trends and patterns within the data.

Following EDA, various regression models are implemented to predict job placements. The models employed include:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Each model is trained, validated, and evaluated to assess its performance in predicting job placements accurately.

# Files
job_placement.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete data analysis process, including data preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.
